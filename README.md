## Introduction
Name, Pronouns, School, Grade Level, Subject


## Purpose 

* Collect audio and visual assets through connecting with Nature
	* Where is the value in intertwining nature and technology?
* Create a multimedia/multimodal website to share your experience
	* What jobs could this be useful in?
* Share your perspectives with the people around you through your website
	* How could the world change if we made more observations accessible?
	* Are there any dangers as to how observations might be shared?
* Connect Coding Nature to Environmental Justice and Data Science
	* Environmental Justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. EJ is an important part of the struggle to improve and maintain a clean and healthful environment, especially for those who have traditionally lived, worked, and played closest to the sources of pollution (EPA, 2017). 
	* Guiding Questions
		* How can we ensure that everyone has access to a healthy environment to live, learn, and work in?
		* How can we use data to understand where (or how) environmental issues impact communities with high poverty more than other communities?
		* What environmental justices/injustices exist in my community?
		* How can we ensure everyone has a voice in the conversation about sustainability and protecting the environment?
		* How do citizens use data to advocate for environmental needs in their community?


## *What exactly is My Nature Outing?...and why code multimodal texts?*

## Text Editors 

Setting up Atom for Windows and CodePad for Chromebooks 

### (Mac)


1. Download "**Atom**" from **Atom.io**
1. Add HTML Preview 
	- from the dropdown menu, select **Atom>Preferences>Install**
	- In the search bar type "**HTML Preview**." 
	- Select the package built by "**HARMSK**." Click "**Install**."
1. Adjust text wrapping 
	 -	from the dropdown menu, select **View>Toggle Soft Wrap** (this will force lines of code to conform to your viewer tab.)

### (Windows)

1. Download "**Atom**" from **Atom.io**
1. Add HTML Preview - from the dropdown menu, select **File>Settings.** In the tab that loads select **+Install** 
1. In the search bar type "**HTML Preview**." 
1. Select the package built by "**HARMSK**." Click "**Install**."
1. Adjust text wrapping - from the dropdown menu, select **View>Toggle Soft Wrap** (this will force lines of code to conform to your viewer tab.)

### (Chromebook)

1. Download "**Code Pad Text Editor**" from Chrome Web Store. 
1. From the dropdown menu, select **Editor>IDE Preferences**
1. Toggle "**Word wrap limit**" to the middle value (this will force lines of code to conform to your viewer tab.)

## README: Get Started working with My Nature Outing

1. Go to repository [My Nature Outing GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Open-Fuego/my-nature-outing)




## Digital Capture

###(iPads, tablets, cellular phones, etc).
We'll want to record audio and take pictures to document our Nature Outing. Because HTML requires specific file formats, we will save time and better control our capture quality by adjusting our settings on the front-end. That said, you can take pictures and record audio in a variety of file formats, and later convert them using sites like [Cloud Convert](https://cloudconvert.com), 

Set iPhone to shoot in **JPG**, an HTML compatable image file format. In **Settings**, change the image "**format**" to "**most compatible**." Android phones shoot **JPEG** by default. You can change **JPEG** to **JPG** by simply renaming the file.) 

HTML requires **WAV** and **MP3** audio files. When capturing sounds in nature, you might want the high quality of **WAV** files. While **WAV** format garners the highest sound quality, it renders large files -- keep recordings short. To record in **WAV**, we recommend sound capture with "**ZOOM Handy Recorder**" APP available for Apple and Android. For podcast recording, we recomend **MP3** formats. 

Again, you can always record audio in a range of formats including IOS default **M4A** and convert them to **MP3 files** 

If you need to record audio directly onto your local computer for podcasts or otherwise, you can do so working directly from FREE mutitrack mixing programs like [Beautiful Audio Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beautiful-audio-editor/okiblndpcefmebnkjnjfplijnelbcjmm?hl=en) (Chrome OS, Chrome Browser, and Android Support) or [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) (Windows and Mac)


##Nature Walk and Break

A quick lesson on on the photography principles and other concepts that will improve your images.

- Framing
- Lines
- Symmetry and Patterns
- Viewpoint, angle
- Background
- Depth
- *Wabi Sabi*

Now let's go experiment. 
-Collect images
-Collect Sounds
-Collect Words


## Lunch 12:00-12:50

## Code Editing

## Publishing to GitHub

See the README (7-10) [My Nature Outing GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Open-Fuego/my-nature-outing)

## Sharing Out

Let's share the URL to our Nature Outing.[Submit HERE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c3kWG7F4a_oJU62Eoxz9jOAXZ6S5KRp2CWUS5asbH0I/edit?usp=sharing)



## Reflection

* Collect audio and visual assets through connecting with Nature
	* Where is the value in intertwining nature and technology?
* Create a multimedia/multimodal website to share your experience
	* What jobs could this be useful in?
* Share your perspectives with the people around you through your website
	* How could the world change if we made more observations accessible?
	* Are there any dangers as to how observations might be shared?
