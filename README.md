## *Why code multimodal texts?*

Think Coding + Nature 


## Digital Capture

###(iPads, tablets, cellular phones, etc).
We'll want to record audio and take pictures to document our Nature Outing. Because HTML requires specific file formats, we will save time and better control our capture quality by adjusting our settings on the front-end. That said, you can take pictures and record audio in a variety of file formats, and later convert them using sites like [Cloud Convert](https://cloudconvert.com), 

Set iPhone to shoot in **JPG**, an HTML compatable image file format. In **Settings**, change the image "**format**" to "**most compatible**." Android phones shoot **JPEG** by default. You can change **JPEG** to **JPG** by simply renaming the file.) 

HTML requires **WAV** and **MP3** audio files. When capturing sounds in nature, you might want the high quality of **WAV** files. While **WAV** format garners the highest sound quality, it renders large files -- keep recordings short. To record in **WAV**, we recommend sound capture with "**ZOOM Handy Recorder**" APP available for Apple and Android. For podcast recording, we recomend **MP3** formats. 

Again, you can always record audio in a range of formats including IOS default **M4A** and convert them to **MP3 files** 

If you need to record audio directly onto your local computer for podcasts or otherwise, you can do so working directly from FREE mutitrack mixing programs like [Beautiful Audio Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beautiful-audio-editor/okiblndpcefmebnkjnjfplijnelbcjmm?hl=en) (Chrome OS, Chrome Browser, and Android Support) or [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) (Windows and Mac)


##Nature Walk and Break

A quick lesson on on the photography principles and other concepts that will improve your images.

- Framing
- Lines
- Symmetry and Patterns
- Viewpoint, angle
- Background
- Depth
- *Wabi Sabi*

Now let's go experiment. 
-Collect images
-Collect Sounds
-Collect Words


##Text Editor Setup
 
### (Mac)


1. Download "**Atom**" from **Atom.io**
1. Add HTML Preview 
	- from the dropdown menu, select **Atom>Preferences>Install**
	- In the search bar type "**HTML Preview**." 
	- Select the package built by "**HARMSK**." Click "**Install**."
1. Adjust text wrapping 
	 -	from the dropdown menu, select **View>Toggle Soft Wrap** (this will force lines of code to conform to your viewer tab.)

### (Windows)

1. Download "**Atom**" from **Atom.io**
1. Add HTML Preview - from the dropdown menu, select **File>Settings.** In the tab that loads select **+Install** 
1. In the search bar type "**HTML Preview**." 
1. Select the package built by "**HARMSK**." Click "**Install**."
1. Adjust text wrapping - from the dropdown menu, select **View>Toggle Soft Wrap** (this will force lines of code to conform to your viewer tab.)

### (Chromebook)

1. Download "**Code Pad Text Editor**" from Chrome Web Store. 
1. From the dropdown menu, select **Editor>IDE Preferences**
1. Toggle "**Word wrap limit**" to the middle value (this will force lines of code to conform to your viewer tab.)

## Get started!

1. Go to repository [My Nature Outing GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Open-Fuego/my-nature-outing)

2. Click **Code** then **Download ZIP** to your local computer. 

3. Find this folder in your downloads. Move this folder to a secure place. You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

4. Download and/or open a text editor like [atom.io](https://atom.io), or [notepad-plus-plus.org](notepad-plus-plus.org). 

5. Use the text editor to open the **style.css** and **index.html** documents from your project folder.  

6. Start working with code by reading through the **index.html** where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text! 

7. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good publishing solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click  "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then click "Commit changes." 

8. Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" and change the setting from "none" to "main." Hit "Save"

9. This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

10. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
